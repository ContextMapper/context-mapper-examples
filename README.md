# DSL Examples [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)
This project contains example DDD Context Maps written in the ContextMapper DSL. Find out more about the DSL project on our website [https://contextmapper.github.io/](https://contextmapper.github.io/) and in the [project report](https://eprints.hsr.ch/722/) published by [HSR](https://www.hsr.ch).

## IDE Requirements
This is a gradle project and can easily be imported into Eclipse by using the "Existing Gradle Project" importer.

### ContextMapper Eclipse Plugin
In order to have language support for editing the CML files (Context Mapper Language), you need to install the ContextMapper Eclipse Plugin.
Use the following Eclipse Update Site to install it:

[https://dl.bintray.com/contextmapper/context-mapping-dsl/updates/](https://dl.bintray.com/contextmapper/context-mapping-dsl/updates/)

## The examples:
The following graphical illustrations of the Context Maps are inspired by [Vernon][2] and [Brandolini][3].

### Insurance Example
In the folder [src/main/resources/insurance-example](./src/main/resources/insurance-example) you find example context maps for a fictitious insurance company, inspired by [Lakeside Mutual](https://github.com/Microservice-API-Patterns/LakesideMutual).

#### Context Map
The insurance example contains an example for a classic DDD context map written in the ContextMapper DSL (CML).

#### Team Map
It further contains a team map, illustrating the teams and their relationships. Additionally, CML allows to define which bounded contexts are implemented by which teams.

### DDD Sample
The folder [src/main/resources/ddd-sample](./src/main/resources/ddd-sample) contains a context map based on the [DDD sample](https://github.com/citerus/dddsample-core) from [Eric Evans DDD book][1]. 

To make the sample interesting for our context mapping language, we splitted the Cargo application into three bounded contexts.

### Architectural Refactoring (AR) Examples
The Context Mapper tool provides several [Architectural Refactorings][4] which can be applied to your models. A documentation of all available refactorings can be found under [https://contextmapper.github.io/docs/architectural-refactorings](https://contextmapper.github.io/docs/architectural-refactorings). The folder [src/main/resources/architectural-refactorings](./src/main/resources/architectural-refactorings) contains example CML models (input and ouput) to illustrate the architectural refactorings purposes.
