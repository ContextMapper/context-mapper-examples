# AR-2: Split Bounded Context by Use Cases
Splits a bounded context by grouping those aggregates together into one bounded context which are used by the same use case(s).

## Context & Rationales

## Goal

## Preconditions
 * 

## Input
 * 
 
## Output
 * 
 
## Example
The following to CML snippets show an example _input_ and _output_ illustrating how this AR works.

### Input
The following bounded context contains one aggregate with two entities:
```

```

### Output
Applying the AR **bla bla** produces two aggregates, one for each entity:
```

```

### Example Sources
 * Example input source: [example-input.cml](./example-input.cml)
 * Example output source: [example-output.cml](./example-output.cml)
