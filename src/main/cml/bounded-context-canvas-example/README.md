# Bounded Context Canvas Example

This example illustrates the Context Mapper DSL capabilities to support Bounded Context canvases.
Full support is a _work in progress_.

<!-- TODO: Improve the example link as more BC canvas features are implemented -->
Please see the [bounded context canvas example](Bounded-Context-Canvas-Example-Stage-1.cml).
